Synopsis
--------

This module allows to create a fabric, and modify or delete an existing fabric on OpenManage Enterprise Modular.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- python >= 3.8.6



Parameters
----------

  state (optional, str, present)
    ``present`` creates a new fabric or modifies an existing fabric.

    ``absent`` deletes an existing fabric.

    Notes: The create, modify, or delete fabric operation takes around 15-20 minutes to complete. It is recommended not to start an another operation until the current operation is completed.


  name (True, str, None)
    Provide the *name* of the fabric to be created, deleted or modified.


  new_name (optional, str, None)
    Provide the *name* of the fabric to be modified.


  description (optional, str, None)
    Provide a short description of the fabric to be created or modified.


  fabric_design (optional, str, None)
    Specify the fabric topology.See the use API https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-in/poweredge-mx7000/omem_1_20_10_ug/smartfabric-network-topologies to know why its topology.

    *fabric_design* is mandatory for fabric creation.


  primary_switch_service_tag (optional, str, None)
    Service tag of the first switch.

    *primary_switch_service_tag* is mandatory for fabric creation.

    *primary_switch_service_tag* must belong to the model selected in *fabric_design*.


  secondary_switch_service_tag (optional, str, None)
    Service tag of the second switch.

    *secondary_switch_service_tag* is mandatory for fabric creation.

    *secondary_switch_service_tag* must belong to the model selected in *fabric_design*.


  override_LLDP_configuration (optional, str, None)
    Enable this configuration to allow Fabric Management Address to be included in LLDP messages.

    Notes: OpenManage Enterprise Modular 1.0 does not support this option. Some software networking solutions require a single management address to be transmitted by all Ethernet switches to represent the entire fabric. Enable this feature only when connecting to such a solution.


  hostname (True, str, None)
    OpenManage Enterprise Modular IP address or hostname.


  username (True, str, None)
    OpenManage Enterprise Modular username.


  password (True, str, None)
    OpenManage Enterprise Modular password.


  port (optional, int, 443)
    OpenManage Enterprise Modular HTTPS port.


  validate_certs (optional, bool, True)
    If ``False``, the SSL certificates will not be validated.

    Configure ``False`` only on personally controlled sites where self-signed certificates are used.

    Prior to collection version ``5.0.0``, the *validate_certs* is ``False`` by default.


  ca_path (optional, path, None)
    The Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) file that contains a CA certificate to be used for the validation.


  timeout (optional, int, 30)
    The socket level timeout in seconds.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - Run this module from a system that has direct access to DellEMC OpenManage Enterprise Modular.
   - This module supports ``check_mode``.

  Overall status of the fabric operation.
