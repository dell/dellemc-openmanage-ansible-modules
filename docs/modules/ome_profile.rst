Parameters
----------

  command (optional, str, create)
    ``create`` creates new profiles.

    ``modify`` modifies an existing profile. Only *name*, *description*, *boot_to_network_iso*, and *attributes* can be modified.

    ``delete`` deletes an existing profile.

    ``assign`` Deploys an existing profile on a target device and returns a task ID.

    ``unassign`` unassigns a profile from a specified target and returns a task ID.

    ``migrate`` migrates an existing profile and returns a task ID.


  name_prefix (optional, str, Profile)
    The name provided when creating a profile is used a prefix followed by the number assigned to it by OpenManage Enterprise.

Return Values
-------------

msg (always, str, Successfully created 2 profile(s).)
  Overall status of the profile operation.


profile_ids (when I(command) is C(create), list, [1234, 5678])
  IDs of the profiles created.


job_id (when I(command) is C(assign), C(migrate) or C(unassign), int, 14123)
  Task ID created when *command* is ``assign``, ``migrate`` or ``unassign``.

  ``assign`` and ``unassign`` operations do not trigger a task if a profile is auto-deployed.

See ExtendedInfo for more information.', '@Message.ExtendedInfo': [{'MessageId': 'GEN1234', 'RelatedProperties': [], 'Message': 'Unable to process the request because an error occurred.', 'MessageArgs': [], 'Severity': 'Critical', 'Resolution': 'Retry the operation.
